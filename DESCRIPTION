Title: Context Aware Random Numbers
Version: 0.2.0
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Michael",
           family = "Barrowman",
           role = c("cre", "aut"),
           email = "myko101ab@gmail.com")
Description: Provides random number generating functions that
    are much more context aware than the built-in functions. The
    functions are also much safer, as they check for incompatible 
    values, and more reproducible.
